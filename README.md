**phpBB Form Creator (Form Maker)**

Our original Form Maker mod was rewritten to include some of the Appform mod code, albeit slightly alter and extended. Therefore a lot of the credit for the new version goes to Sajaki @ www.bbdkp.com for his Appform Mod (A phpBB3 MOD).

Validation of form data relies on HTML5 (client side validation) and is supported in Firefox, Opera, Chrome, IE 10 and other browsers...

If the forms are used to collect crucial data, you may wish to add your own javascript validation code...  

**Mod Validation**  
This code has been validated by phpBB dev team but code here may contain minor updates...

Current code tested with phpBB 3.0.14
