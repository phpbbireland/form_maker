### phpBB Form Creator (Form Maker)  

Most of the credit for this mod goes to Sajaki @ www.bbdkp.com for his Appform Mod (A phpBB3 MOD).
The original Form Maker mod was rewritten to encompass the Appform code, albeit slightly alter and extended...

Validation of form data relies on HTML5 (client side validation) and is supported in Firefox, Opera, Chrome, IE 10 and other browsers (Safari does not currently support HTML5 form validation)...  
If the forms are used to collect crucial data, you may wish to add your own javascript validation code....

Please note we do not use conformation for every action in the ACP...  
This speeds up management substantially... (feels like Ajax ;)  

The install does not activate the .MOD, do this manually...  
In ACP go to SYSTEM > Administration Control Panel...  
Select the .MOD module...  
From the Add module dropdown find ACP_FORM_MAKER_CONFIG ... select it and activate it...  
Refresh page and it will appear....
